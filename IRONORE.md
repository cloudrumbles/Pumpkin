# Ironore backend

This fork maintains the Pumpkin backend used by Ironore singleplayer.

- Fork: https://github.com/cloudrumbles/Pumpkin
- Maintained branch: `main`
- Upstream: https://github.com/Pumpkin-MC/Pumpkin
- Upstream base: `204a94ed895f041a845630d5a23c094705a0704e`
- Base release: `0.2.0+26.3-26.51`
- Java protocol: 777 (Minecraft 26.3)
- Pumpkin world DataVersion: 4903

Ironore records the exact supported fork commit in
`tools/pumpkin-backend.json`. Locally built artifacts carry their own executable
hash and build provenance. Publisher checksums apply only to upstream publisher
artifacts.

## Changes

- Persist runtime clock values through save, shutdown, unload and restart.
- Ignore superseded teleport acknowledgements while retaining the current request.
- Remove both live and serialized block-entity records when a container is removed.
- Read and save `NoGravity`, and honor `NoAI` for bat decisions.
- Parse namespaced function IDs and validated block-state properties for
  `/setblock` and `/fill`.

Regression tests accompany these changes. A passing build or unit test does not
establish survival parity or compatibility with vanilla saves.

## Validation

Use an explicitly installed Rust toolchain supporting Rust 1.96 or newer. On the
development host the selected toolchain is `nightly-2026-08-21`.

```sh
cargo +nightly-2026-08-21 test --locked -p pumpkin-command
cargo +nightly-2026-08-21 test --locked -p pumpkin-world world_clock_tests
cargo +nightly-2026-08-21 test --locked -p pumpkin --lib
```

The generated data crate needs a larger compiler stack on this toolchain. The
host qualification uses `RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432`, one Cargo job, no debug info,
no incremental compilation and 256 development codegen units. These are QA
build settings; use a separately measured release build for performance claims.

The local Minecraft 26.3 Java reference is derived from the named game JAR.
The official server JAR used for runtime comparison has SHA-256
`d052f14d7a173734fba553711e5b570162e2f2a313267ee31a21b975a679be64`.
Keep Java source, game assets, test saves and executable artifacts outside git.
Use disposable worlds for save/reopen and protocol tests.

## Updating upstream

Preserve upstream history and review changes on a separate branch. Before
advancing Ironore's pin, check protocol and configuration changes, regenerate
artifact provenance, and repeat the affected command, persistence and real
client/server checks. Never open a user's only world copy during qualification.

## Remaining parity limits

Pumpkin owns a clock per World. Vanilla 26.3 has a server clock manager and
dimensions refer to shared clock IDs; this fork repairs persistence within
Pumpkin's existing architecture. Block-state command parsing does not add
block-entity NBT arguments or complete block-predicate matching. Teleport
acknowledgement handling does not yet validate the 26.3 accepted pose. Other
upstream gameplay gaps remain tracked upstream.
